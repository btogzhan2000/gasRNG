* This is a Proof-of-Concept code for gas-efficient random number generation protocol. For business purposes, please develop the protocol code with extra care. 

* The implementation uses VDF verification from https://github.com/kilic/evmvdf, thus Apache license applies. Any other VDF verification algorithm can be used in the protocol.
